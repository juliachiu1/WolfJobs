# WolfJobs 2.0
Need a side Hustle or want to get some quick rewards? Wolfjobs provides the perfect platform to meet your requirements.

A job portal which provides recruiters a platform to post temporary job openings and an oppurtunity for candidates to apply for the jobs without being concerned about permanent associations. 

# New Features
The original WolfJobs lacks tons of features, users cannot update their profile, job status won't change, applicants cannot keep track on their favorite jobs...etc

With WolfJobs 2.0 we solved all the problems with these improvements
1. We added an advanced search mechanism where applicants can filter jobs by their locations, job type or job industry, or you can just search with keywords
2. We added autofill so that applicant's info will autofill when they are filling out an application
3. We added support for users to update their profile
4. Applicants can now save their favorite job and keep track on their application through email

# Future Scope
  Searching for a new job and finding the right person for a job is no doubt a crucial task within itself. Hence adding further functionalities to our platform becomes very important task for better user experience.

  The future scope of Wolf Job includes various functionalities as stated below defined in 2 phases

  ### Phase 2
  1.	**Job Analysis** – In phase 2, wolf Job will provide the functionality of analysing various aspects of a job. Job Analysis based on various parameters using graphical representation will help in making prediction on which jobs are more preferred and for which jobs applicants have more inclination. Hiring managers can then decide what rewards and salary to be given to the applicants of that job. Even applicants will get to know, which job is being preferred among other applicants.

  2.	**Chatbot Integration** – Our platform Wolf Job will also provide the functionality of Chatbot integrated with our website so that user can easily interact with the bot and get to know about various features of our web application and have a nice interactive experience.

  3.	**Resume Upload** – In Phase 2 of Wolf Job, user can even upload Resume / CV and cover letter for any particular job. Uploading resume will be very helpful for the hiring manager to get a better idea about an applicant’s background and profile.

  4.	**Interview Appointment Scheduling** – In future phase 2, Wolf Job will also provide the facility for the hiring manager to organize an interview appointment for the job based on applicant’s availability and convenient time uploaded by the hiring manager. Either of the users can upload their availability time in the G-sheet and using google calendar appointments can be organised.
